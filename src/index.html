      <h2 class="section-title white">DESTINATION</h2>
      <img src="img/castello-monaci.png" style="width:150px; margin:30px;">
      <p>We’re heading to the beautiful Castello Monaci, San Pancrazio Salentino BR, Puglia, Italy.</p>
      <p>With one of us coming from Italian heritage we couldn’t resist the urge to get married in such a beautiful country and we were lucky enough to find this stunning venue in our search. Not only is it beautiful but it’s also a vineyard that produces lots of delicious wine and for those of you who know us best you know we LOVE wine! There’ll be plenty for everyone to taste on the day.</p>
      <p>Of course we’ve had to do some research and visit Puglia a couple of times and we’ve decided to base ourselves in the beach town of Porto Cesareo. It’s a beautiful little town with lots of restaurants and bars, only 25 minutes from the castle and has one of the most beautiful coast lines I’ve seen in Italy. The food is also amazing and the local historical town of Lecce is great for a spot of sightseeing.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title white animate">WHERE TO STAY</h2>
      <br>
      <p>There’s plenty of nearby accommodation including B+Bs, hotels and air bnb’s. However Porto Cesareo is a popular holiday destination for the Italians and accommodation goes fast, so get booking as soon as you can!</p>
      <br>
      <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
      <br>
      <strong>We’ll be staying at Gran hotel Paradise in the town.</strong>
      <p>If you’d like to stay here we will be booking through the hotel directly so please email us at jenjameswedding19@gmail.com if you’d like to book a room. We’re hoping to negotiate a discount. Fyi this hotel is currently unavailable to book on booking.com for 2019 so you’ll need to come through us to book. They have a range of different price rooms from 130 per night for a double sea view room with breakfast to 100 per night for standard double room with breakfast. They also have rooms for 3 or 4 people available.</p>

      <br>
      <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
      <br>
      <strong>Another great hotel option is Isola Lo Scoglio Hotel</strong>
      <p>It’s only 5 mins walk from where we will be staying and a couple of minutes to all the restaurants and bars. This hotel is close to a late night club so potential to be a bit noisy on Saturday night in the early hours. We recommend to just join the party.</p>

      <br>
      <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
      <br>
      <p>There are also many other hotel and B&B & air bnb options in town to choose from for a range of prices but all are very affordable. Best to check on the map as some can be deceiving of their location. We’re more than happy to help, if you’d like us to look at where you’re thinking and check the location just drop us an email at jenjameswedding19@gmail.com.</p>

      <h5>Q: Should I make a holiday of it?</h5>
      <p class="grey">A: Absolutely yes! We would love to see as many of you in the lead up to the big day. Especially the pre-party on Saturday 15th June where some food and drinks will be on us to get the party started!!</p>
      <h5>Q: Are children invited?</h5>
      <p class="grey">A: As much as we love the little ones, the wedding will be for adults only. We just want you all to be able to relax and really let your hair down.</p>
      <h5>Q: Is there a gift list?</h5>
      <p class="grey">A: Nope, you making it up to Italy is enough of a present! However, if you feel compelled to give us one, a contribution to our honeymoon would be most appreciated.</p>
      <h5>Q: What is the weather likely to be like?</h5>
      <p class="grey">A: We hope it will be warm sunshine as this is the usual climate for Puglia in June! Let’s all do the sun dance. Recommend bringing sun cream and a hat.</p>
      <h5>Q: What is the dress code for the wedding day?</h5>
      <p class="grey">A: Dress to impress! Guys in suits and ladies in your best dresses! We know you’ll all be looking fabulous! No shorts please.</h5>
